Welcome to the MovieLens 100K dataset for use in Graph Neural Network projects!

This repo simply contains a copy of the [MovieLens 100K Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset). 

This repository contains a copy of the MovieLens 100K dataset, which was collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. The dataset consists of 100,000 ratings from 1000 users on 1700 movies, and was released in 1997. It is one of the earliest and most widely-used datasets for research on collaborative filtering and recommendation systems.

The dataset is provided in the ml-100k folder, and includes three files: u.data, u.item, and u.user. The u.data file contains the ratings data, with each line representing a single rating in the following format: user_id item_id rating timestamp. The u.item file contains information on the movies, including the movie title and release date. The u.user file contains information on the users, including their age and gender.

We hope that this dataset and notebook file will be useful for your Graph Neural Network projects! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
